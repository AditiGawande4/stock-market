# ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Market Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The **Real-Time Stock Market Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive tool designed to visualize, analyze, and explore real-time stock market trends. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as **Python**, **AWS Glue**, **Athena**, **Apache Kafka**, and **SQL** to build an end-to-end pipeline for processing and visualizing stock market data. **AWS S3** and **EC2** services, along with the **boto3 SDK**, are integrated for seamless cloud data storage, computation, and processing.

## Technology Stack
### 1. **Python**
   - Core programming language for processing data and creating visualizations.
   - Libraries Used: `pandas`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `streamlit`.

### 2. **Apache Kafka**
   - Simulates real-time stock market data streams.
   - Kafka **producers** publish real-time stock data to topics.
   - Kafka **consumers** retrieve data for processing and analysis.

### 3. **AWS Glue**
   - Transforms raw data into a structured format.
   - Catalogs data for querying in AWS Athena.

### 4. **AWS Athena**
   - Runs SQL queries on structured data stored in **AWS S3**.
   - Provides quick access to both real-time and historical data.

### 5. **AWS S3**
   - Serves as the central storage for raw and processed data.
   - Enables efficient querying via AWS Athena.

### 6. **AWS EC2**
   - Hosts Kafka producer and consumer services.
   - Ensures seamless execution of the data streaming pipeline.

### 7. **boto3 SDK**
   - Python SDK for programmatically interacting with AWS services.
   - Used for tasks like uploading data to S3, running Glue jobs, and querying Athena.

### 8. **SQL**
   - Query language for fetching and analyzing stock market data.

### 9. **Streamlit**
   - Framework for creating an intuitive, interactive dashboard.
